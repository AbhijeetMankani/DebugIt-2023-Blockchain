This is a Blockchain Demonstration Project
The Aim of this Project is to provide an Application that can be used to Teach about the Practical Working of a Blockchain.
This Project has been made Modular, so the user can take a peek inside, in between operations

Note: Put your MYSQL root account password in the .env file any file of the Project. 
Since this Project uses MYSQL, it needs to password to create and use the database

## How to setup the Blockchain:

## How to Find the Nonce:
1. Run the Miner.py file
2. Wait for it to Find a working Nonce through Brute Force
3. After Finding the Nonce, it will be displayed

## How to Submit your Nonce:
1. Run the Dashboard.py file
2. Enter your login Credentials
3. When asked to enter the action, enter 'B'
